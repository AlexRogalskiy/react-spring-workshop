# Interactive react-spring workshop (WIP)

## How to get started

1. Run `yarn` and `yarn start`
2. Navigate to `src/1-animating-with-springs/README.md`. (It's suggested to view the README.md files for each lesson in a markdown interpreter for a better experience and to avoid getting potentially spoiled by seeing hints before you need them.)  
3. Complete the tasks specified in the README by editing the index.js file.
4. Later tasks build on earlier ones, so please complete them in order.

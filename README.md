A few react-spring tasks for a workshop at Stash. Still a WIP!

It's suggested to view the README.md files for each lesson in a markdown interpreter.

## How to get started

1. Run `yarn` and `yarn start`
2. Navigate to src/1-animating-with-springs and read the README.md. Complete the tasks specified in the README by editing the index.js file.
3. Later tasks build on earlier ones, so please complete them in order.

## Lessons

### 1. Spring basics
